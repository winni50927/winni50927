## 📚 Projects  
Here, I showcase **self-initiated projects** focused on data, modeling, and analytics in diverse and interesting domains.  
I love exploring new challenges, learn best practices, and apply data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems.  

### 🔹 Featured Projects  
- **[Succeed in Rummikub](https://github.com/winni50927/rummikub-simulation)** – A famous board game, Rummikub (my favorite!). I used **Monte Carlo simulations** to analyze **10,000 games**, identifying key factors that impact **winning probabilities**.  
- **[Detecting Constructive Feedback](https://github.com/winni50927/constructive-feedback-nlp)** – No time to read hundreds of reviews for your **product or content**? I developed an **NLP-based model** to automatically detect the **most valuable and actionable feedback**.  
- **[Predicting Viral Content](https://github.com/winni50927/viral-content-prediction)** – Want to know if your **content will go viral before posting**? I built a **machine learning model** that analyzes key engagement metrics and predicts the likelihood of success.
